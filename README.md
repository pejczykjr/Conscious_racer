# Conscious racer
- The goal of this project is to create the game for university classes. It is aimed at practicing motor-visual agility and familiarization with basic traffic law.

## Game description
This game is designed to enable the users to improve their motor-visual coordination and practice knowledge of the traffic law. 
The user will steer the vehicle in 3 lanes - control left-right arrows. His task will be to achieve the longest possible distance.
After a certain distance, more traffic signs, traffic lights or asking the player to choose the correct answer will be displayed.
The game will require the user to react quickly while moving the car and overtaking other cars, and the player will have a limited time to respond or interact, such as:
pressing the spacebar to stop at a red light or after displaying a information about the road with priority given
marking a choice about not turning when seeing a sign telling you to go straight
After a collision with another car, expiration of the response/interaction time or an incorrect choice, the game ends.
